# Backend

## Compilation

### Prerequisites

+ GNU CMake >= 3.13.4 (lower is ok but you have to change cmakelist.txt)
+ A C/C++ compiler with >=`c99` & >=`c++17` support
+ llvm-13



### Compile

+ Currently we donâ€™t provide compile for backend only. Please refer to `readme.md` located at root directory for compilation.
+ If you want to compile it, you may try to modify `export.cpp` and `cmakelists.txt` to build a program that can generate `.ll` and `.o` file.
